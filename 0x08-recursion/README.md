# C - Recursion
*Basic to intermediate tasks to help understand the concept of recursion. Loops are not allowed*
___
## 0-puts_recursion.c
A function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
## 1-print\_rev\_recursion.c
A function that prints a string in reverse.
## 2-strlen\_recursion.c
A function that returns the length of a string.
## 3-factorial.c
A function that returns the factorial of a given number.
If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error
Factorial of 0 is 1
## 4-pow\_recursion.c
A function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
## 5-sqrt\_recursion.c
A function that returns the natural square root of a number.
## 6-is\_prime\_number.c
A function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.
## 100-is\_palindrome.c
A function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.
## 101-wildcmp.c
A function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.
